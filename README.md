# Cataclysm_Game_Engine
This is a personal project I am starting as a student. I love graphics, development and games and decided to start building a web based game and graphics engine. The first focus will be on simple voxel based graphics leading into more complex and realistic looking graphics. The ultimate dream for this project is to have a game engine that is not only platform independent but will also be able to work both on a PC or console system such as traditional games but also in the browser and mobile enabling players to play against a whole lot more players.
